Discovery of Novel APOC3 Isoforms 

Apolipoprotein C-III (APOC3) plays a crucial role in triglyceride metabolism and is closely associated with cardiovascular disease risk. Elevated APOC3 levels contribute to higher plasma triglycerides and increased risk of atherosclerosis, making APOC3 expression an attractive and logical therapeutic target. While studying various APOC3 transcript isoforms expressed in hepatoma cell lines (HepG2, Huh7) and healthy liver tissue using publicly available long-read RNA sequencing, we found three novel APOC3 isoforms. All three novel isoforms are splicing variants of the MANE transcript, APOC3-201. Isoforms 1 and 2 exhibit splicing patterns similar to APOC3-201 from exons 2-4; however, isoform 1 shares its exon 1 splicing pattern with APOC3-203, while isoform 2 features an extended exon 1 that includes exon 1a, the adjacent intronic region, and exon 1b. The third isoform closely resembles APOC3-201, but lacks exon 2, which contains the protein-coding start site. These isoforms were validated through RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. Remarkably, similar APOC3 splicing patterns and transcript variants were observed in Caco-2 cells, a model of the small intestine, indicating that these isoforms are not liver-specific. Further studies are needed to elucidate the functional roles of these novel isoforms and their contribution to the regulation of APOC3 gene expression.
